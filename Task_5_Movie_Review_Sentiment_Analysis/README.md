# 🎬 Task 5 – Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis of movie reviews using machine learning (Task 5 - Future Intern Internship)


This project is part of my **Machine Learning Internship at Future Intern (June–July 2025)**. The objective is to build a model that classifies movie reviews as **positive** or **negative** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

- Develop a sentiment analysis model using movie reviews
- Clean and preprocess text data
- Train and evaluate models like **Naive Bayes** and **Logistic Regression**
- Optionally explore deep learning (e.g., LSTM or Transformers)
- Use appropriate metrics to evaluate model performance

---

## 🗃️ Dataset

- IMDb Movie Reviews Dataset (or similar)
- 50,000 labeled reviews:
  - **1** = Positive
  - **0** = Negative

## 🧠 Models Used

- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- (Optional) Deep Learning with LSTM

---

## 🧪 Workflow

### Preprocessing
- Lowercasing text
- Removing punctuation, numbers, and special characters
- Removing stopwords
- Tokenization
- Vectorization using **TF-IDF**

### Training & Evaluation
- Train-test split (80-20)
- Trained models using scikit-learn
- Evaluated using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score
  - Confusion Matrix

---

## 📈 Results

- Both Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression showed strong results
- Accuracy ~90% with balanced precision and recall
- Logistic Regression slightly outperformed Naive Bayes on most metrics
